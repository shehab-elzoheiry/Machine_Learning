# Machine Learning Scripts
### This repository will be gathering all my scripts for building models:
  * Notebook for use case with classificaiton task of categorical data. 
  * The data itself is not provided as it is a private property of a company, however the script and the presentation are available.
  * The built models are logistic regression, decision tree, K-nearest neighbors and support-vector machine. 
  * They were optimized to achieve highest accuracy score, which was then compared accross models to identify the best for this dataset.
  * plot_Decision_Tree.py is an extra script for plotting the built decision tree.
